# mqtt-broker

A demonstration of a jig running an MQTT server using Netty.

## Configuration

First examine the `config.clj` file, which lists 4 components.

The first 2 components are provided by Jig's netty-mqtt extension, which provides Netty encoder and decoder components.

The third component is a custom component provided in the example's
source directory. It registers a function under a well-known key,
`:jig.netty/handler-factory`. The function gets called with no
arguments, and provides a Netty ```io.netty.channel.ChannelHandler```.

Thanks to the supplied codec (provided by Xively's clj-mqtt project) the
actual protocol implementation is rather trivial.

```clojure
     #(proxy [ChannelHandlerAdapter] []
        (channelRead [ctx msg]
          (case (:type msg)
            :connect (reply ctx {:type :connack})
            :pingreq (reply ctx {:type :pingresp})
            :publish (println (format "PUBLISH MESSAGE: topic is %s, payload is '%s'" (:topic msg) (String. (:payload msg))))
            :disconnect (.close ctx))))))

```

## Usage

Run lein repl from the Jig project directory.

1. Create a symlink from `$HOME/.jig/config.clj` to the `config.clj` in this directory.

```
$ mkdir ~/.jig
$ cd ~/.jig
$ ln -s ~/src/jig/examples/mqtt-broker/config.clj
```

2. Cd into the Jig directory

```
$ cd ~/src/jig
```

3. Start Jig

```
$ lein repl
nREPL server started on port 41713 on host 127.0.0.1
REPL-y 0.3.0
Clojure 1.5.1
Welcome to Jig!

(go)       -- start the system
(reset)    -- reset the system
(refresh)  -- recover if a reset fails due to a compilation error
(menu)     -- show this menu again
Jig user> (go)
:ready
```

4. In a new terminal window, download and install [mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/download/)

5. Test the MQTT broker by publishing messages.

Use mosquitto to publish some test messages.

```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "/foo" -m "message"
```

You should see messages printed out on Jig's standard out.

## Discussion

This example should give you a feeling for how easy it is to integrate
different components to form systems.

None of the components in Jig are more than a few lines of code, but
when they are combined the result is both powerful and extremely flexible.
